Additionally, I learned the basically terminologies used when working with Git and GitHub. As well, I learned about SSH keys and learned to generate my own for my GitHub account. The only thing I would do differently is to clone with HTTPS rather than SSH.</p>

I did not get to finish the tutorial, however, I did follow alongside. The tutorial demonstrated how to create a To-Do List using React as well as using npm and npx commands. The photo on the left shows a To-Do List that displays tasks in the console that the user typed into the textbox. As well, I successfully changed my default website page from my README.md file to <a href="index.html"> <u style={{"color" : "blue"}}>Home.</u></a></p>

This clicking app does not only let to add by one, but allows you to subtract by one as well. After finishing this tutorial, I gained a better understanding of React's format. To further familiarize myself with React, I started another tutorial, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGcsHMXbSOA&ab_channel=developedbyed"><u style={{"color" : "blue"}}>React Tutorial For Beginners</u></a>" which puts more emphasis on the concepts and structures.</p>

                <p className='paragraph'> I began the process of rewriting my website using React. During this process, I created a <b><i>component</i></b> folder under my <b><i>src</i></b> folder which included Javascript contents for the header and body of the website. The React website to the left is identical to the website from September 27, 2022 (Hosting a Website). The only difference is that this websites navigation bar is still in the works and the "styles" for the Internship-Logs content needs to be converted into React format. I am working to solve these issues to create an exact replica.</p>

                <p className='paragraph'> I started off the day of picking it up from where I left off. I successfully converted all of my <i>Internship-Logs</i> content into React format. As well I spent some time trying to resolve issues relating to React Routers and Switches. Unfortunately, I had no success but I got a lead from my mentor. Soon after, I had a meeting with my mentor to which he taught me windows shortcuts, which are essential to becoming a great software engineer. From this, I was able to navigate around my computer more effectively and efficiently without a mouse.

                <p className='paragraph'> I found a solution to the Switch error I had mentioned previously. Through research, I learned that <b>Routes</b> served the same purpose as <b>Switch</b>. After trial and error, I was successfully able to replace the use of Switches with Routes by importing <b>Routes</b> from <b>'react-router-dom'</b>. Additionally, I researched Route Paths through which I learned the concept of capitalizing the first letter when assigning the JavaScript file to an element; capitalizing the first letter would render the JavaScript file individually.</p>

                <p className='paragraph'> My mentor advised me to take notice of processes I find myself constantly doing that take up time to-which I could have spent being more productive such as coding, debugging, researching etcâ€¦ To my surprise, I found myself constantly using the same inline styling for my internship logs. This essentially led me to create CSS classes which I could reuse for future logs. As well, I figured out a solution to my text alignment and font size errors which originated from incorrect slash placements in tags when converting HTML to JSX.</p>
